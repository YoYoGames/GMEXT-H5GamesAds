## DESCRIPTION

The Ad Placement API supports interstitial (including prerolls) and rewarded ads. Developers can use the API to create potential ad breaks in their games or other interactive media. The API takes care of deciding exactly when to show ads, taking into account many factors including the type of placement, whether a suitable ad exists, the frequency that ads are being shown, and more. You can control these settings without having to release a new version of your game.

## FEATURES 

- Interstitial Ads
- Reward Ads
- Mute/Unmute

## DOCUMENTATION

The full documentation of the API is included in the extension asset (included files).
